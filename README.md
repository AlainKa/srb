# Strasbourg Resto Bistro

Self-taught project. The aim is to create a blog type application that allows people to create blog posts that reference a restaurant.

The application is meant to have the following features :

* The post contains pictures uploaded by the user of the restaurant. 
* Given the address provided by the user, the post displays a map of the restaurant with a marker.
* Global map of strasbourg with markers for all the restaurants that had at least one post.
* Pointing on a given marker allows the user to see associated posts (probably full display of the best post and links for the others).  
* Web access

Additional ideas :
